	The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks
	that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. 
	It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, 
	business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by 
	a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 
	The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, 
	such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), 
	electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.

	The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the 
	United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust, 
	fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. The primary precursor network,
	the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and 
	military networks in the 1980s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a 
	new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, 
	led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, 
	and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by 
	the early 1990s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and 
	generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and 
	mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by 
	academia since the 1980s, the commercialization incorporated its services and 
	technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
